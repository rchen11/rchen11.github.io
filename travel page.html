    			Another reason you should visit Hawaii because of <strong>Na Pali Coast State Wilderness Park</strong> 
    			in <em>Kauai County</em> is a really beautiful place.  This area is home to <em>Hawaiian Aliâ€™i (royalty)</em>
    			and is known for the lavishly flowing waterfalls and freshwater river.  There is a abundance of 
    			flora and fauna, and an excess supply of natural food sources from valley to sea like
    			taro, sweet potatoes, breadfruit, fresh fish and more.
