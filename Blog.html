          Snow Day! 2/27</h3>
          <p>
          Today we didn't have school I was so happy.  I slept in until 11:00 am then I got up and started doing my Elearning assignments.
          But my stupid little cousin and sister needed help on their Elearning assignments which took 3 hours they just kept crying over and over.
          Once I was done helping them I started doing my Elearning assignments which took me another 3 hours by that time it was around 5:30 pm.
          After finishing all my assignments I took my little cousin and sister outside to the park for them to play.

          Chinese class</h3>
          <p>
          We started the class with doing the Do Now and the Exit Slip. During Chinese class today we studied for 15 minutes for the 10 point 
          vocabulary quiz.  Then we did the vocabulary quiz, when I finished I started on my workbook, everyone finished in around 15 minutes.
          When everyone finished the quiz the teacher taught us about a new subject which was fruits and vegetables.
